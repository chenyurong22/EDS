# Commercial Notice

Xaloqi EDS uses a dual-license model. This file makes the license
boundary explicit for anyone reading or contributing to this repository.

## What is free (GPL v2)

The following components are open source under the GNU General Public
License version 2 (`LICENSE` at repo root):

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `core/` | UDS server, session manager, security, safety, service handlers |
| `transport/` | ISO-TP, CAN transport, Zephyr CAN driver integration |
| `config/` | DID database, DTC database, routine database |
| `platform/` | Zephyr port, NVM store, flash ops, mutex, timer, watchdog |

GPL v2 means: you may use, study, modify, and redistribute these files,
provided that any combined work you distribute — including ECU firmware
that links against this stack — is also distributed under GPL v2, with
source code made available to recipients.

**If you cannot meet the GPL v2 conditions** (for example, because your
ECU firmware is proprietary and you cannot release its source code),
you must purchase a commercial license. See below.

Examples in `examples/` are licensed under Apache 2.0 and may be used
freely in both open-source and proprietary projects without GPL
obligations.

## What requires a commercial license

The following components are **not** covered by GPL v2. They require a
paid commercial license from Xaloqi:

| File / Directory | Description |
|---|---|
| `tools/codegen.py` | Publicly readable. Generating code for proprietary firmware requires a commercial license. Functional use requires `tools/templates/` (Developer/Professional tier). |
| `tools/testgen.py` | Automated pytest + CAPL test generator |
| `tools/config_parser.py` | Publicly readable. Used by `codegen.py` — same license requirement applies. |
| `tools/templates/` | All Jinja2 code generation templates |
| `ide/vscode-extension/` | VS Code extension for EDS |
| `docs/EDS_Safety_Manual_*` | Safety Manual (Professional tier) |
| `docs/MISRA_DEVIATION_LOG.md` | MISRA C Deviation Log (Professional tier) |
| `docs/EDS_Requirements_Traceability_Matrix.csv` | RTM (Professional tier) |

Using any of the above files in a project — commercial or otherwise —
without a valid Xaloqi commercial license is a violation of Xaloqi's
intellectual property rights.
