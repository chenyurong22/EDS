#
# PURPOSE: MISRA C:2012 compliance analysis using cppcheck --addon=misra
#          and GCC MISRA-relevant warning flags.
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   misra_report.json    — machine-readable findings (CI-consumable)
#   misra_report.txt     — human-readable summary for code review
#   misra_violations.csv — violation table for spreadsheet import
#
# SCOPE:
#   Production C sources in:
#     core/          — UDS server, session, security, safety, services
#     transport/     — ISO-TP, CAN transport, Zephyr CAN binding
#     config/        — DID database, DTC database, NVM mirror
#     generated/     — YAML-generated handlers, wrappers, init
#
#   EXCLUDED from MISRA scope:
#     harness/       — integration test harness (not shipped in ECU)
#     tests/         — unit test code (not shipped in ECU)
#     platform/      — Zephyr RTOS platform wrappers (third-party boundary)
#
# MISRA CHECKER STRATEGY:
#   Primary:   cppcheck >= 2.6 with --addon=misra
#              Requires: pip install cppcheck-misra  OR  apt install cppcheck
#   Secondary: GCC MISRA-relevant warning flags (always available)
#
#   If cppcheck is not available, the script falls back to GCC-only analysis
#   and clearly documents this in the report. CI can be configured to
#   treat absence of cppcheck as a soft failure (warning, not error).
#
# DEVIATION HANDLING:
#   Known justified deviations are defined in MISRA_DEVIATIONS below.
#   Any violation matching a justified deviation is flagged as JUSTIFIED
#   rather than OPEN in the report. Unjustified violations are OPEN.
#
#   The distinction matters for ISO 26262 assessment:
#     JUSTIFIED — documented, reviewed, accepted risk
#     OPEN      — requires action or additional justification
#
# USAGE:
#   python3 misra_analysis.py                    # full analysis
#   python3 misra_analysis.py --gcc-only         # GCC flags only (no cppcheck)
#   python3 misra_analysis.py --src-dirs core transport
#   python3 misra_analysis.py --out /tmp/misra_report.json
#   python3 misra_analysis.py --dry-run          # validate config, no analysis
#
# CI INTEGRATION:
#   The report JSON contains:
#     "open_violations": N      — violations without approved deviation
#     "justified_violations": N — violations with approved deviation record
#     "checker_available": bool — whether cppcheck was used
#   CI gates on open_violations == 0 (all findings must be justified or clean).
#
# ISO 26262 PART 6 WORK PRODUCT:
#   This script and its output constitute work product evidence for:
#     - Table 1, Method 1b: Static code analysis
#     - Table 4, Row 1: Enforcement of coding guidelines (MISRA C:2012)
#   The misra_report.json file should be archived with each release.
