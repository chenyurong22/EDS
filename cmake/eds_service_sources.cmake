# =============================================================================
# cmake/eds_service_sources.cmake — canonical UDS service handler source list
#
# USAGE (from any example CMakeLists.txt):
#
#   include(${DIAG_ROOT}/cmake/eds_service_sources.cmake)
#   target_sources(app PRIVATE ${EDS_SERVICE_SRCS})
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
#   service_registration.c references all 16 UDS service handler symbols by
#   name. Every build target must link against all 16 .c files or the linker
#   fails with "undefined reference to uds_service_0xNN_handler".
#
#   Previously each example enumerated the list independently. That caused
#   real bugs: when a new SID was added, examples were missed, and the only
#   symptom was a linker error at customer build time (not in CI).
#
# ADDING A NEW SID:
#   Add exactly one line here. All 20 example targets pick it up automatically.
#   No other CMakeLists.txt changes required.
