# Contributing to Xaloqi EDS

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Before you open a pull request, read
this document — the dual-license model creates obligations that differ from a
typical open-source project.

---

## Dual-license model and the CLA requirement

EDS is published under two licenses:

| Component | License |
|---|---|
| Runtime stack: `core/`, `transport/`, `config/`, `platform/` | GPL v2 |
| ECU examples: `examples/` | Apache 2.0 |
| Tooling: `tools/codegen.py`, `tools/testgen.py`, Safety Manual | Commercial license |

This dual-license approach — the same model used by [Quantum Leaps QP](https://www.state-machine.com/qm/)
and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/oem/) — means that **all
contributions to the GPL v2 runtime stack require a signed Contributor License
Agreement (CLA).**

### Why the CLA is required

Contributions to `core/`, `transport/`, `config/`, and `platform/` may be included
in builds distributed under the commercial license. Without a CLA, the commercial
license cannot legally cover your contribution. The CLA does **not** transfer
copyright — you retain full ownership. It grants the right to relicense your
contribution as part of the commercial offering.

### How to sign the CLA

Before your first pull request touching the runtime stack is merged:

1. Email **contact@xaloqi.com** with subject: `CLA — GitHub username: <your-handle>`
2. Include your full name, GitHub username, and employer name (if contributing on
   behalf of an employer — your employer's sign-off may also be required)
3. You will receive the CLA to review and sign electronically
4. Once signed, your handle is added to `CLA_SIGNATORIES.md` and future PRs
   from that account can be merged without delay

**Contributions to `examples/` (Apache 2.0) do not require a CLA.**
Bug reports, documentation improvements, and issue comments never require a CLA.

## What we welcome

### Always welcome — no CLA needed

- Bug reports via GitHub Issues
- Documentation corrections and improvements
- New or improved ECU examples under `examples/`
- Additional unit tests that expose existing bugs
- CI/build system improvements
- YAML configuration improvements to existing examples

### Welcome with CLA — runtime stack contributions

- Bug fixes in `core/`, `transport/`, `config/`, `platform/`
- New UDS service handlers (must include a unit test module in `tests/unit_runnable/`)
- Platform port additions (new board or RTOS target)
- ISO-TP timing or performance improvements
- Safety wrapper improvements with documented traceability

### Not accepted

- Changes that remove or weaken any step of the 5-step ASIL-B safety wrapper chain
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`) anywhere in the stack
- Recursion in any safety-critical module
- Changes that break the `native_sim` CI build or cause any of the 39 unit tests to fail
- Hand-written changes to files under `generated/` — these are codegen output;
  fix the template in `tools/templates/` instead
- External runtime dependencies not already present in the stack

---

## Development workflow

### 1. Open an issue first

For anything beyond a trivial bug fix, open a GitHub Issue before writing code.
This avoids duplicate effort and lets us confirm the change fits the architecture
before you invest time in it.

### 2. Fork and branch

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xaloqi/EDS
git checkout -b fix/isotp-consecutive-frame-timeout
```

Branch naming: `fix/`, `feat/`, `docs/`, `test/`, `chore/` prefix, kebab-case description.
Target branch for pull requests: `main`.

### 3. Coding conventions

- **C standard:** C11 (`-std=c11`)
- **No dynamic memory.** No `malloc`, no `free`, no VLAs. The `no-malloc-check` CI job
  enforces this with a hard grep gate.
- **No recursion** in any module in `core/` or `transport/`.
- **Return type:** All public API functions return `uds_status_t`. No `void` on any
  path that can fail.
- **Unit test:** Every new module in `core/` or `transport/` needs a corresponding
  `tests/unit_runnable/test_<module>.c`. New service handlers need both a unit test
  and an entry in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`.
- **SPDX header** on every new file:
  - Runtime stack: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only`
  - Examples: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`
- **Generated files:** If you changed `diagnostics_config.yaml` or any template under
  `tools/templates/`, regenerate and commit the output:
  ```bash
  python3 tools/codegen.py \
    --config examples/basic_ecu/diagnostics_config.yaml \
    --out generated/ \
    --safety-wrappers --asil-level B --test-gen
  ```

### 4. Verify before submitting

```bash
# Regenerate if you touched YAML or templates
python3 tools/codegen.py \
  --config examples/basic_ecu/diagnostics_config.yaml \
  --out generated/ \
  --safety-wrappers --asil-level B --test-gen

# All 39 unit tests must pass
bash build_tests.sh

# All 68 harness tests must pass
bash build_harness.sh

# native_sim build must succeed
west build -b native_sim examples/basic_ecu \
  -- -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=boards/native_sim.overlay
```

CI runs all 10 jobs automatically on pull requests. A PR will not be merged if
any CI job is red.

## Adding a new UDS service handler

Use this checklist when implementing a new SID. Every item is required — gaps
here have caused real CI failures and customer-visible linker errors.

### Stack (EDS repo)

- [ ] `core/uds_types.h` — add `UDS_SID_*` constant
- [ ] `core/uds_services/services.h` — declare handler, bump `UDS_SERVICE_TABLE_COUNT`
- [ ] `core/uds_services/service_registration.c` — add table entry
- [ ] `core/uds_access_table.c` — add ACL entry
- [ ] `core/uds_access_table.h` — bump `UDS_ACCESS_TABLE_DEFAULT_COUNT`
- [ ] `core/uds_services/service_0xNN.c` — implement handler
- [ ] `cmake/eds_service_sources.cmake` — add one line (**this propagates to all 20 examples automatically**)
- [ ] `tests/unit_runnable/test_service_0xNN.c` — unit tests (aim for 14+ cases)
- [ ] `tests/CMakeLists.txt` — `add_diag_test(test_service_0xNN)`
- [ ] `build_tests.sh` — add to `STACK_SRCS` and `TESTS` arrays, bump count in comment
- [ ] `ci.yml` — bump unit test count in job comment/display name
- [ ] `misra_analysis.py` — add `core/uds_services/service_0xNN.c` to **DEV-MULT-01**
  `files` list (Rule 15.5 — early-return guard pattern used by all handlers)

### Docs

- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` — entry under `[Unreleased]`
- [ ] `README.md` — service count and SID list (two places)
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` — unit test count (three places)
- [ ] `docs/llms.txt` — service count (two places), remove from "not implemented" list
- [ ] `docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` — add row to service table, remove from "out of scope"
- [ ] `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` — service count
- [ ] `docs/README.md` — service count (two places)
- [ ] `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md` — service count

### EDS-toolchain repo

- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` — service count (one place)

> The per-example `CMakeLists.txt` files no longer need individual updates — adding
> one line to `cmake/eds_service_sources.cmake` covers all 20 build targets.
> The EDS-toolchain examples inherit the list when they include
> `${DIAG_ROOT}/cmake/eds_service_sources.cmake` at build time.

### Lessons learned from adding 0x2F (2026-06)

These caught CI failures on a real PR. Record them here so the next engineer
doesn't repeat the same debugging session.

**Counter conflict resolution during rebase**

When two branches both increment the same numeric constant from the same base
value (common when two SIDs land close together), naively keeping either side
is wrong. If main went A → B and your branch went A → C, the merged value is
A + (B−A) + (C−A). In practice: count the actual table entries in the merged
file and set the constant to match. Affected constants:

- `UDS_SERVICE_TABLE_COUNT` in `core/uds_services/services.h`
- `UDS_ACCESS_TABLE_DEFAULT_COUNT` in `core/uds_access_table.h`

GCC catches a wrong `UDS_SERVICE_TABLE_COUNT` as
`warning: excess elements in array initializer` on `service_registration.c`.
`misra_analysis.py` classifies this as **Rule N/A** (the warning has no `-W`
flag suffix). If you see "Rule N/A" in the MISRA report pointing at
`service_registration.c`, check the array size constant first.

**misra_analysis.py DEV-MULT-01 requires manual enumeration**

The Rule 15.5 deviation (`DEV-MULT-01`) applies only to files explicitly listed
in its `files` array in `misra_analysis.py`. Every new service handler `.c` file
must be added to that list or CI reports 15+ open violations. The entry goes
between the neighbouring service files (alphabetical / numerical order).

**MISRA Rule 2.5 — define only macros you reference**

Constants defined in the `.c` file for documentation (e.g., named control
parameter values) that are never referenced in the code itself trigger Rule 2.5
violations. Either use them explicitly in `switch`/`if` branches, or remove
them and rely on the file-level comment to document the protocol values.

## AI-assisted development

Xaloqi EDS uses AI-assisted development tooling (Claude Code / Anthropic Claude) to
accelerate code generation, test generation, and code review. This section documents
how that tooling is used, what controls are applied, and where responsibility sits — in
response to procurement and safety audit questions about AI-generated content in
safety-relevant code.

### What AI tooling is used for

- First-draft generation of boilerplate C code, header files, and test stubs
- Review acceleration: surfacing potential MISRA violations, null-dereference paths,
  and missing error returns before static analysis runs
- Documentation drafting and changelog generation
- Codegen template authoring (the `tools/templates/` Jinja2 templates)

### What it is not used for

- Autonomous merge decisions — no AI output is merged without human sign-off
- Bypassing CI — all commits, regardless of origin, must pass all 10 CI jobs
- Architecture decisions — module boundaries, safety architecture, and API contracts
  are defined by the project maintainer

### Human review and validation requirements

Every commit that touches the EDS codebase, regardless of how it was generated, must satisfy:

1. **CI gate:** All 10 CI jobs green — unit tests, integration tests, static analysis,
   Zephyr build, FreeRTOS build, DoIP integration, harness tests, robustness tests.
2. **Human sign-off:** The committing engineer reads, understands, and takes
   responsibility for every line before it is staged. AI-generated output is a
   starting point, not a finished deliverable.
3. **MISRA scan:** The `static-analysis` CI job runs `misra_analysis.py` on every PR.
   Zero new violations are permitted.

### Safety-relevant changes — heightened review

Changes to any of the following files or modules require explicit human sign-off in the
PR description (`Reviewed-by: <name>`) in addition to CI passage:

- `core/uds_safety.c` — ASIL-B 5-step safety check engine
- `core/uds_session.c` — UDS session FSM (ISO 14229-1 §7.4)
- `core/uds_security.c` — SecurityAccess seed/key validation (ISO 14229-1 §10.4)
- `core/uds_services/service_0x27.c` — SecurityAccess service handler
- `core/uds_services/service_0x19.c` — ReadDTCInformation handler
- `transport/isotp.c` — ISO-TP framing and flow control (ISO 15765-2)
- `transport/doip/doip_server.c` — DoIP server (ISO 13400-2)
- Any file under `config/` that defines DTC status persistence

AI-generated output is **never merged directly** to `main` for these files without
a deterministic validation step: the static analysis job, the full unit test suite,
and explicit human code review.

### Maintainer responsibility

Xaloqi retains full engineering and legal responsibility for all committed code
in this repository, regardless of the method by which it was generated.
The use of AI tooling does not transfer, reduce, or qualify that responsibility.
AI-generated code that is merged into EDS is EDS code — it is subject to the same
MISRA conformance requirements, safety review process, and ISO 26262 obligations as
any other contribution.

## Reporting bugs

Open a GitHub Issue. Include:

- EDS version (git tag or full commit hash)
- Target board and Zephyr version
- Minimal reproduction: `diagnostics_config.yaml` + `west build` command + full error output
- What you expected vs. what happened

For security vulnerabilities, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead — do not use
public issues for security reports.
